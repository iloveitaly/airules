# Copilot & Cursor LLM Instructions

Going to try to centralize all my prompts in a single place and create some scripts to help convert from copilot to cursor, etc.

## Usage

All instructions in [[instructions.md]] are exploded out into the various files with default rules applied.

```shell
just build
```

Executes this explosion process.

You can then download the rules into your project:
